# Dataset Overview – Atlas Labs (DataCamp HR Analytics Case Study)
This project leverages the fictional Atlas Labs dataset, originally developed for DataCamp's “Case Study: HR Analytics in Power BI” course. The dataset represents simulated HR records from a mid-sized technology company, designed to mimic real-world human resources data while preserving privacy and compliance.

# Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to analyze employee attrition patterns and identify the key factors influencing turnover at Atlas Labs. By integrating and modeling the data in Power BI, the analysis seeks to:
- Quantify overall attrition rates and identify high-risk employee groups.
- Segment the workforce by demographic, departmental, and performance characteristics.
- Explore relationships between job satisfaction, work-life balance, compensation, and attrition.
- Provide actionable, data-driven insights to inform HR strategies aimed at improving employee retention and engagement.
